# GEA_GPT_Materials

Various materials related to using Gen AI in Med Ed can be found here. "GEA 2025 - Using LLMs to Grade OSCEs" is my most recent workshop.

Similar / more general presentations on the topic can also be found here: 
- the NICE GenAI Workshop is a broader overview for Med Ed
- the JMU GenAI Workshop was presented to JMU Assessment & Measurement faculty and students, and is slightly more technical in nature.

Materials related to the AI Best Practices (Policy, etc.) can be found [here.](https://github.com/runyoncr/IAEA_AI_Best_Practices)

Materials related to "Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to Apply Analytic Rubrics to Post-Encounter Notes" can be found in this repository: [GPT_Study_Materials](https://github.com/runyoncr/GPT_Study_Materials/). This manuscript is currently under review and, if accepted, will also be posted in this repository. 

For those who want to learn more about the technical aspects of GPTs, I highly recommend watching [3Blue1Brown's series on Neural Networks / Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi). Some conceptual knowledge of matrix algebra will be helpful. Of particular interest will be [Chapter 5: But what is a GPT? Visual intro to transformers](https://youtu.be/wjZofJX0v4M?si=Ase-j746fiy-2KRK) and [Chapter 6: Attention in transformers, visually explained](https://youtu.be/eMlx5fFNoYc?si=ODqjp1C4L1KRfn-L).
