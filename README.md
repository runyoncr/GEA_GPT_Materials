# GEA_GPT_Materials
Materials for the GEA & NICE (NBME Invitational Conference for Educators) GPT workshops. Will be frequently updated until November 2024 (maybe longer). The reference materials are incomplete; we will continue work on this starting in September.

Link to ChatGPT for trying examples: [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)

For those who want to learn more about the technical aspects of GPTs without taking a course, I highly recommend watching [3Blue1Brown's series on Neural Networks / Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi). Some conceptual knowledge of matrix algebra will be helpful. Of particular interest will be [Chapter 5: But what is a GPT? Visual intro to transformers](https://youtu.be/wjZofJX0v4M?si=Ase-j746fiy-2KRK) and [Chapter 6: Attention in transformers, visually explained](https://youtu.be/eMlx5fFNoYc?si=ODqjp1C4L1KRfn-L).
