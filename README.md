# GEA_GPT_Materials

Various materials related to using Gen AI in Med Ed can be found here. "GEA 2025 - Using LLMs to Grade OSCEs" is my most recent workshop. That workshop is a result of a series of experiments, which has now been published in Medical Teacher: ["Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to Apply Analytic Rubrics to Post-Encounter Notes"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0142159X.2025.2504106). The syntax used in those experiments can be found in one of my other repositories: [GPT Study Materials](https://github.com/runyoncr/GPT_Study_Materials).

Similar / more general presentations on the topic can also be found here: 
- NICE 2025 LLM Primer is the workshop I presented at the NBME Invitational Conference for Educators (NICE)
- GEA 2025 - Using LLMs to Grade OSCE Notes" is the workshop I presented at CGEA 2025 and SGEA 2025
- JMU GenAI Workshop was presented to JMU Assessment & Measurement faculty and students, and is slightly more technical in nature.

For those who want to learn more about the technical aspects of GPTs, I highly recommend watching [3Blue1Brown's series on Neural Networks / Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi). Some conceptual knowledge of matrix algebra will be helpful. Of particular interest will be [Chapter 5: But what is a GPT? Visual intro to transformers](https://youtu.be/wjZofJX0v4M?si=Ase-j746fiy-2KRK) and [Chapter 6: Attention in transformers, visually explained](https://youtu.be/eMlx5fFNoYc?si=ODqjp1C4L1KRfn-L).

In some talks I've mentioned that some companies are starting to make products specifically designed to host downloaded open-source LLMs. The [NVIDIA DGX Spark](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/products/workstations/dgx-spark/) is one example. I haven't used this product and am not endorsing it; it's shown here for demonstration purposes only.
