For those who want to learn more about the technical aspects of GPTs, I highly recommend watching [3Blue1Brown's series on Neural Networks / Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi). Some conceptual knowledge of matrix algebra will be helpful. Of particular interest will be [Chapter 5: But what is a GPT? Visual intro to transformers](https://youtu.be/wjZofJX0v4M?si=Ase-j746fiy-2KRK) and [Chapter 6: Attention in transformers, visually explained](https://youtu.be/eMlx5fFNoYc?si=ODqjp1C4L1KRfn-L).
